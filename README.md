# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields based on environmental and agricultural inputs using regression models. It uses real-world agri-data and demonstrates how data science can support sustainable farming.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Correlation
4. Model Training (Linear, Random Forest)
5. Performance Evaluation

## Dataset
Dataset from Kaggle: [Crop Yield Dataset](link_here)

## Outcome
Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting crop yield based on weather and soil conditions.

## Sample Visualizations
*(Insert graphs from your analysis)*

## Real-World Relevance
Helps agri-planners and farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, input planning, and risk mitigation.
